How Ethernet works
In order to send this data, it is necessary to fragment it into small fractions, which is called "Packet Switching". Thanks to this, data is prevented from overlapping, counting each of these packages with specific information that will allow the package itself to know where it has to go, that is, to which computers they must access.

All about Ethernet

One of the main problems that took place before the appearance of the CSMA / CD, was precisely that sometimes several teams sent packets at the same time, which caused a collision between the data that affected the transmission. However, thanks to this protocol, before sending the packets, the devices contact the network to find out if they are free to carry out the transmission, so that, if this is the case, send them to the data or, on the contrary, it will wait for it to be released to make the shipment.

Thanks to this, the data arrives in perfect condition and there is no collision between them at any time, which guarantees a much more fluid operation and above all ensures that the data will always remain in perfect condition.

Advantages of Ethernet versus Wi-Fi

Possibly [Cable companies](https://www.fieldengineer.com/blogs/observations-solutions-cables-companies/) at this point you are considering the differences between Ethernet connections and Wi-Fi connections. Basically, an Ethernet connection is a Network connection via cable, while a Wi-Fi connection is a Network collection wirelessly.

It should be noted that we should not be confused, that is, we can establish Wi-Fi connections between our computers, usually through a router, but the main difference is that we use Ethernet with the idea of connecting several computers within a private or internal network. the company itself or housing, while Wi-Fi and is generally used for internet connection.

That is, we can use both types of connection in any case, but each of them for a different type of connection. However, the objective of both is to exchange data between computers, but, as we mentioned at the beginning of this section, they do it differently, this connection being established wirelessly in the case of Wi-Fi and cable in the case of Ethernet

Ethernet vs. Wifi

The main difference between Wi-Fi and Ethernet is the speed of the connection and the reliability, since the wireless system can be very convenient since it avoids the use of cables, but also considerably slows down the connection, while with an Ethernet connection, as long as we have a cable of the appropriate category based on the maximum connection speed that we have, it will allow us to take advantage of all the speed and distribute it adequately among all the connected equipment.

That is, with Ethernet we will transfer information more quickly and with greater reliability than with Wi-Fi, while with Wi-Fi we will have more convenience to establish the connection, avoiding the use of cables between the equipment. We remind you that we can also use an Ethernet cable to connect the router or modem to our computer, but this would also be part of the internal connection of the office, that is, with this cable what we do is connect our computer equipment to the peripheral that is responsible for providing internet, but it would not be a connection to the Internet itself.

As a detail, it is important to take into account not only the category of the cable, that is, depending on the speed at which we want to transmit the data, we must choose one type of cable or another, so that at present, the categories Most common are Cat. 5, Cat. 5e, Cat 6 and Cat 6a, allowing maximum connections of 100, 1000, 1000 and 10000 Mb / s respectively, achieving greater effectiveness of the connection as we increase the category and in relation to the distance of the connection.
